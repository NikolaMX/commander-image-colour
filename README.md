# Commander Image Color

Recolor the static commander images on the loading cinematic, and randomly on the start screen.

It's not a cheap operation and there well be visual hiccups - trying again with webgl shaders is left as an exercise for the reader.

There are a number of [known pixel issues](https://github.com/JustinLove/commander_image_color/issues) (and surely more I haven't noticed) that could use refinement of selection or replacement

Since one of the base colors is yellow, I don't believe it's possible to avoid the construction stripes without an image-specific exclusion area.
